# Contribute

_First things first. If you're here to contribute to L2Beat for Bitcoin or Bitcoinrollups.io, you're in the right spot! This page is not 100 percent complete. Please join our [telegram group](https://t.me/+8rv-1I2gkmQ4ZmJh) to get involved._

Thanks for checking out the contributor section for Bitcoinrollups.io!

We're building an informational resource about the development of zk-rollups on Bitcoin. Everything we do is initially documented in GitHub and distributed via our website or social media accounts. This includes, but is not limited to, tweet threads for [@Bitcoinrollups](https://twitter.com/BitcoinRollups), The Bitcoin Rollup Newsletter, and our website. We're also contributing to the ["L2Beat for Bitcoin"](https://twitter.com/BitcoinRollups/status/1719181008640045473) initiative, and use our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/+8rv-1I2gkmQ4ZmJh) to coordinate that.

We're excited that you're interested in contributing, and wanted to outline a few ways you can get involved :)

## Get involved

### Download a wallet for tips

Bitcoinrollups is currently managed by a volunteer, so we do not pay bounties for contributions. However, we do tip contributors a small amount for completing tasks listed in the issues section. We can send tips via Lightning, Zcash or Monero. 

- For Lightning, you can download [Phoenix Wallet](https://phoenix.acinq.co/).
- For XMR, you can download the [Monero.com](http://monero.com/) wallet.
- For ZEC, you can download [Nighthawk Wallet](nighthawkwallet.com)

### Head to the issues section

We post the items where we need contributions in [the issues section](https://github.com/januszgrze/bitcoinrollups/issues) of this github repo. Head there and decide which ones you'd like to take on :) You'll need a GitHub account for this.

### Comment on the task you want to complete

Comment on the task that you'd like to complete. This will notify the repo's owner that you're working on it.

You can work within GitHub or your preferred platform. For example, if you're writing a tweet thread and you prefer to do that in Google docs, you can write the thread there and then copy and paste as a pull request in this repo to get it added to this repository.

Think we're missing something? Add an issue and provide as much context and information for review as possible!

### Create a pull request

When you finish completing your task, create a pull request to either (1) edit the document you're looking to change or (2) add a document within a specific folder in the repo. Here's a tutorial on how to create a pull request and contribute to an open-source project like Bitcoinrollups:

### Comment your address, wait for merge, and get tipped in BTC, XMR, or ZEC

After you create your pull request, comment your lightning, ZEC, or XMR address. After we accept the pull request and merge it into the repository, we will send you a tip. We will then add your content to the relevant medium (social media, website, etc.).

## That's it!
