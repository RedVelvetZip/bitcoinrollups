# Collabs

This section of the repo is for collaborations that I work on related to the [bitcoinrollups.io](https://bitcoinrollups.io) website. The main one is "l2Bit", which is a site similar to [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com), that outlines risks related to using Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.

This section can extend to incubating other website ideas, content collaborations, research papers, and more. Feel free to jam here!
