This section of the repo contains code related to the L2Bit/Bitcoin Layers website. You can find an example page [here](https://mattys-dandy-site.webflow.io/l2bit/l2bit-rollup-example) (this page isn't updated in a few minor areas).

We are currently hosting the hosting service, so code is placed into individual div blocks. In this repo, each div block is categorized by a letter in the beginning of its title, with a short description following. 

As you can see in the last four pages in this repo, we fill the values for the body section of the website with separate div blocks. This is because our hosting service only allows for 10,000 characters in each div block. If you are creating a page using this framework, you will insert the values in those four pages respectively, and it will populate the "body" section when we upload the code to our website builder.
