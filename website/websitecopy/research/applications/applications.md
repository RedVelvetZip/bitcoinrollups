Rollups are primarily viewed as scaling solutions in the Ethereum space. But in Bitcoin, rollups could also enable a whole suite of new functionality for BTC the asset and Bitcoin users.

This is because Bitcoin is limited in what it can do on the Layer 1, so by enabling rollups, we can explore new applications and continue to pay fees that secure the Bitcoin network. In the event we get trust-minimized bridging (possibly through [BitVM](https://bitcoinrollups.io/bitvm), then these uses cases would provide further utility for BTC the asset in a more trustless way.

You've read a lot about the infrastucture behind this on our site. Let's dive into some real use cases Bitcoin rollups can provide!

### New smart contract languages

### Stronger privacy guarantees

### Trustlessly enabling BTC-backed stablecoins

### Decentralized finance applications

### And more!
